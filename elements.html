									<p>Adobe revealed that the source code for its Acrobat PDF document-editing software and ColdFusion web application creation products had also been illegally accessed, furthermore, the hackers also stole parts of the source code to Photoshop, Adobe’s famous picture-editing program. The information that has been collected could allow programmers to analyse how Adobe's software works and copy its techniques.	</p>
									<p>Later in May, Adobe switched several of its products to a subscription model, meaning its customers needed to register an account and provide their payment card details in order to qualify for upgrades.</p>

									<p>Multiple reports suggest U.S. government officials believe the attack is tied to the North Korean government, who expressed outrage over the Sony-backed film "The Interview," an action-comedy centered on an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

Computer networks running three major South Korean banks and the country’s two largest broadcasters were targets of cyber attacks that some experts suspected originated in North Korea.</p>
										<p>The malware is called “DarkSeoul” and was first identified only about a year ago, with the purpose to evade some of South Korea’s most popular antivirus products and to shut down computers.</p>

They gained access to customers service database, installed malwares on the system and took sensitive data such as full names, phone numbers, email addresses, payment card numbers, credit card verification codes. It is estimated that the hackers were able to take data from up to 40 million credit and debit cards of shoppers.</p>
									<p>Eventually, target’s shares closed down 2.2 percent at $62.15 on the New York Stock Exchange, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index fell 0.06 percent.</p>

										<p>The hackers used “forged cookies”, which are parts of code that are stored in the user’s browser cache so that a website doesn’t require a login every time they visit that specific website. These cookies can allow a third party to access users’ accounts without a password by misidentifying anyone using them as the owner of an email account. The stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, passwords and encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.</p>

									<p>News of this data breach, reignites concerns regarding the sale of personal data by credit card bureaus to third-party companies. Experian, TransUnion and Equifax are known to sell such data to third-party companies, most of the time, customers are unaware of such information.
